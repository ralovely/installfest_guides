# Setting Up Your Development Environment

## The Many Paths

_There are many paths up the mountain,
but the view from the top is always the same._

Ruby on Rails development requires a few components to be setup on your machine,
Ruby of course, a shell terminal, and a few other binaries…

Depending on your machine, your OS, the currently installed softwares,
seting up a decent environment can take minutes… or hours.

In these guides, we will show you some of the many ways you can get up and running and start coding as fast as possible.

## Gotchas
Once setup, everything Ruby and Rails related is the same.
Beware, though, some steps might be a little different form one environment to the other.
We will mention them along the guides.
